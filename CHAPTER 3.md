# DRIVING VALUE THROUGH DATA
CHAPTER FOCUS

* Identifying many roles data plays in organizations
* Delivering insight from data
* Recognizing that data is an asset
* Exploring four approaches to data analytics

IDENTIFYING THE ROLES OF DATA

* Data's value extends beyond specific departments like data analytics or IT.
* It's used extensively in various daily business functions, highlighting its overall significance.
* For data to be truly valuable, it needs to be:
  * High-quality (accurate and reliable)
  * Secure (protected from unauthorized access)
  * Compliant with regulations
  * Accessible to authorized personnel when needed
* The passage argues that data isn't just relevant to specialists, leaders, or specific departments, but holds importance across the entire organization.

# OPERATIONS

* Businesses have various day-to-day activities to fulfill their goals.
* These activities, called operational functions, differ based on the specific needs of each business.
* Some core functions, like payroll or marketing, are common across most organizations.
* On the other hand, some support functions, like IT or warehousing, might not be essential for every business. For instance, a service business might not need a warehouse.
  
Operations rely on data: Businesses use various data and information sources to run their day-to-day activities.
Operations generate data: Business activities also create new data as a byproduct.


* Data drives decision-making: Businesses use data to measure performance, like HR tracking open positions and filling times. This data helps make informed decisions.
  
* Operations generate data: HR activities themselves create data, such as candidate applications, evaluations, and system logs. This cycle applies to other operational functions as well.
  
* Data usage within operations: Businesses use data for various purposes:
  * Running systems (e.g., automatic inventory reordering)
  * Making decisions (e.g., sales teams reporting to leadership)
  * Sharing information internally and externally
* Automation in data management: Many data-related tasks within operations are automated. For instance, systems can send notifications based on triggers (e.g., reminder emails about unsubmitted reports).

In summary, data is a crucial element in business operations. It's used to analyze performance, make decisions, run systems, and share information. Operations also generate a significant amount of data through their daily activities.


# STRATEGY

* Strategy sets the direction: Every organization has a strategy, even if informal. It's a roadmap to achieve goals and overcome challenges. This can apply to the entire organization or individual departments.
  
* Operations put it into action: Operations are the day-to-day activities that execute the strategy and make it a reality.
  
* Data fuels success: A winning combination involves a data-driven strategy (informed by data) delivered through efficient operations.
  
* Developing a strategy: This typically involves:
  * Analyzing the business environment (internal and external factors)
  * Drawing conclusions based on the analysis
  * Creating a plan guided by principles (work nature, founder values, etc.)
* In essence, strategy is the "what" and "why" while operations are the "how." Both are crucial for organizational success, and data plays a vital role in making informed decisions throughout the process.
