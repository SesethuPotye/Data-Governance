# DRIVING VALUE THROUGH DATA
CHAPTER FOCUS

* Identifying many roles data plays in organizations
* Delivering insight from data
* Recognizing that data is an asset
* Exploring four approaches to data analytics

IDENTIFYING THE ROLES OF DATA

* Data's value extends beyond specific departments like data analytics or IT.
* It's used extensively in various daily business functions, highlighting its overall significance.
* For data to be truly valuable, it needs to be:
  * High-quality (accurate and reliable)
  * Secure (protected from unauthorized access)
  * Compliant with regulations
  * Accessible to authorized personnel when needed
* The passage argues that data isn't just relevant to specialists, leaders, or specific departments, but holds importance across the entire organization.

# OPERATIONS

* Businesses have various day-to-day activities to fulfill their goals.
* These activities, called operational functions, differ based on the specific needs of each business.
* Some core functions, like payroll or marketing, are common across most organizations.
* On the other hand, some support functions, like IT or warehousing, might not be essential for every business. For instance, a service business might not need a warehouse.
  
Operations rely on data: Businesses use various data and information sources to run their day-to-day activities.
Operations generate data: Business activities also create new data as a byproduct.


* Data drives decision-making: Businesses use data to measure performance, like HR tracking open positions and filling times. This data helps make informed decisions.
  
* Operations generate data: HR activities themselves create data, such as candidate applications, evaluations, and system logs. This cycle applies to other operational functions as well.
  
* Data usage within operations: Businesses use data for various purposes:
  * Running systems (e.g., automatic inventory reordering)
  * Making decisions (e.g., sales teams reporting to leadership)
  * Sharing information internally and externally
* Automation in data management: Many data-related tasks within operations are automated. For instance, systems can send notifications based on triggers (e.g., reminder emails about unsubmitted reports).

In summary, data is a crucial element in business operations. It's used to analyze performance, make decisions, run systems, and share information. Operations also generate a significant amount of data through their daily activities.


# STRATEGY

* Strategy sets the direction: Every organization has a strategy, even if informal. It's a roadmap to achieve goals and overcome challenges. This can apply to the entire organization or individual departments.
  
* Operations put it into action: Operations are the day-to-day activities that execute the strategy and make it a reality.
  
* Data fuels success: A winning combination involves a data-driven strategy (informed by data) delivered through efficient operations.
  
* Developing a strategy: This typically involves:
  * Analyzing the business environment (internal and external factors)
  * Drawing conclusions based on the analysis
  * Creating a plan guided by principles (work nature, founder values, etc.)
* In essence, strategy is the "what" and "why" while operations are the "how." Both are crucial for organizational success, and data plays a vital role in making informed decisions throughout the process.
  

# IMPORTANT 
* Data and experience go hand-in-hand: While data is crucial, successful strategy development considers both data and the experience-based perspectives of people involved. An over-reliance on one or the other can be detrimental.
* Strategy as an ongoing process: A best practice is to revisit and potentially adjust the strategy periodically (e.g., every 6 months). This can be driven by new data (knowledge and insights) that emerges.
* Adapting to changing environments: In today's fast-paced world, organizations need to respond quickly to changing conditions. Data should be the foundation of this response system, allowing for adjustments as needed.
  
In short, strategy development should be a data-driven process that also incorporates valuable human experience. It's an ongoing process that can be adapted based on new information and a changing environment.

# DECISION- MAKING 

* Data's highest value lies in enabling better decision-making.
* The sheer volume and quality of data available today surpass anything ever seen before.
* Consumers: Search engines empower people (e.g., patients) to be more informed about their situations. This can be helpful (fewer unnecessary doctor visits) but also lead to problems if the information is inaccurate (headaches for doctors dealing with misinformation).

* Businesses: Organizations benefit from readily available data. This allows for faster, more timely decisions based on real-time insights into strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.  Previously, businesses might have had to wait for quarterly reports, but now they can get a clearer picture even with interim data, which is still better than having no information at all.


* Quality over quantity: Having a lot of data isn't enough. It needs to be accurate and up-to-date to be valuable.
* Bad data is harmful: In fact, bad data can be worse than no data at all. Using bad data to make decisions can lead to negative consequences, ranging from minor mistakes to business closure.
* Success relies on good data: For data-driven decision-making to be successful, decision-makers need access to high-quality data at the right time.

# MEASURING
* Businesses constantly measure: Organizations, intentionally or unintentionally, are always gathering data through various measurements.
* Measurement leads to better management: The saying "what gets measured gets managed" holds true. By measuring aspects of the business, leaders gain insights to improve management.
* Not everything is measurable: While measurement is important, some things are inherently difficult to quantify.
* Data drives informed decisions: Ultimately, leaders rely on information derived from this measurement data to make informed choices.

  
In essence, measurement is a crucial tool for businesses to track performance, gain insights, and make better decisions.
Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is most often described in numerical terms, whereas qualitative data is descriptive and expressed in terms of language

* Data (Quantitative): Focuses on measurable aspects. Here, data describes the flight's altitude (50,000 meters) and speed (750 km/h).
* Information (Qualitative): Provides descriptive details. In this case, information describes a smooth flight and good meals.
  
Both data and information contribute to understanding the journey, although the value might depend on the audience.

In short, data is the raw numbers, while information adds context and meaning to that data.


* Measurement drives information: The kind of information needed determines how you measure data. This includes what data is captured, when, where, and how.
  
* Focus on what matters: Only collect and measure data that has a clear purpose. While some argue for collecting data "just in case" of future needs, it's crucial to be mindful of resource limitations and potential costs associated with storing unused data.

In essence, target your data collection on what's essential to get the information you need, avoiding unnecessary data gathering


The quote's message: Not everything measurable is truly important, and some crucial things might not be easily quantifiable.
Data enthusiasm vs. relevance: Just because you can collect data doesn't mean it's always valuable. Focus on gathering data that has a clear purpose and provides meaningful insights.
In other words, don't get carried away by the possibility of collecting data. Prioritize collecting data that truly matters and contributes valuable information.

MONITORING 

* Definition: Monitoring is the continuous process of collecting and assessing the performance of something, like a project, system, or process.
* Comparison and Targets: The collected data is often compared to existing standards or desired goals. For instance, a factory machine might be expected to produce a certain number of units per hour (e.g., 100 widgets). Monitoring helps track if this expectation is being met.
* Benefits: Monitoring serves various purposes across different activities:
  * Identifying performance issues (meeting expectations)
  * Ensuring continuity (things keep functioning as intended)
  * Maintaining stability (avoiding unexpected changes)
  * Guaranteeing reliability (performing consistently as expected)
In short, monitoring is a continuous evaluation process that helps ensure things are functioning as planned and meeting established goals.

Involved in monitoring is the data produced by the thing being evaluated. Itâ€™s also the data that is produced as a product of monitoring. For example, the deviation from the expected result.
