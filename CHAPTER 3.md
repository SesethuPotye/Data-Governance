# DRIVING VALUE THROUGH DATA
CHAPTER FOCUS

* Identifying many roles data plays in organizations
* Delivering insight from data
* Recognizing that data is an asset
* Exploring four approaches to data analytics

IDENTIFYING THE ROLES OF DATA

* Data's value extends beyond specific departments like data analytics or IT.
* It's used extensively in various daily business functions, highlighting its overall significance.
* For data to be truly valuable, it needs to be:
  * High-quality (accurate and reliable)
  * Secure (protected from unauthorized access)
  * Compliant with regulations
  * Accessible to authorized personnel when needed
* The passage argues that data isn't just relevant to specialists, leaders, or specific departments, but holds importance across the entire organization.

# OPERATIONS

* Businesses have various day-to-day activities to fulfill their goals.
* These activities, called operational functions, differ based on the specific needs of each business.
* Some core functions, like payroll or marketing, are common across most organizations.
* On the other hand, some support functions, like IT or warehousing, might not be essential for every business. For instance, a service business might not need a warehouse.
  
Operations rely on data: Businesses use various data and information sources to run their day-to-day activities.
Operations generate data: Business activities also create new data as a byproduct.


* Data drives decision-making: Businesses use data to measure performance, like HR tracking open positions and filling times. This data helps make informed decisions.
  
* Operations generate data: HR activities themselves create data, such as candidate applications, evaluations, and system logs. This cycle applies to other operational functions as well.
  
* Data usage within operations: Businesses use data for various purposes:
  * Running systems (e.g., automatic inventory reordering)
  * Making decisions (e.g., sales teams reporting to leadership)
  * Sharing information internally and externally
* Automation in data management: Many data-related tasks within operations are automated. For instance, systems can send notifications based on triggers (e.g., reminder emails about unsubmitted reports).

In summary, data is a crucial element in business operations. It's used to analyze performance, make decisions, run systems, and share information. Operations also generate a significant amount of data through their daily activities.


# STRATEGY

* Strategy sets the direction: Every organization has a strategy, even if informal. It's a roadmap to achieve goals and overcome challenges. This can apply to the entire organization or individual departments.
  
* Operations put it into action: Operations are the day-to-day activities that execute the strategy and make it a reality.
  
* Data fuels success: A winning combination involves a data-driven strategy (informed by data) delivered through efficient operations.
  
* Developing a strategy: This typically involves:
  * Analyzing the business environment (internal and external factors)
  * Drawing conclusions based on the analysis
  * Creating a plan guided by principles (work nature, founder values, etc.)
* In essence, strategy is the "what" and "why" while operations are the "how." Both are crucial for organizational success, and data plays a vital role in making informed decisions throughout the process.
  

# IMPORTANT 
* Data and experience go hand-in-hand: While data is crucial, successful strategy development considers both data and the experience-based perspectives of people involved. An over-reliance on one or the other can be detrimental.
* Strategy as an ongoing process: A best practice is to revisit and potentially adjust the strategy periodically (e.g., every 6 months). This can be driven by new data (knowledge and insights) that emerges.
* Adapting to changing environments: In today's fast-paced world, organizations need to respond quickly to changing conditions. Data should be the foundation of this response system, allowing for adjustments as needed.
  
In short, strategy development should be a data-driven process that also incorporates valuable human experience. It's an ongoing process that can be adapted based on new information and a changing environment.

# DECISION- MAKING 

* Data's highest value lies in enabling better decision-making.
* The sheer volume and quality of data available today surpass anything ever seen before.
* Consumers: Search engines empower people (e.g., patients) to be more informed about their situations. This can be helpful (fewer unnecessary doctor visits) but also lead to problems if the information is inaccurate (headaches for doctors dealing with misinformation).

* Businesses: Organizations benefit from readily available data. This allows for faster, more timely decisions based on real-time insights into strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.  Previously, businesses might have had to wait for quarterly reports, but now they can get a clearer picture even with interim data, which is still better than having no information at all.


* Quality over quantity: Having a lot of data isn't enough. It needs to be accurate and up-to-date to be valuable.
* Bad data is harmful: In fact, bad data can be worse than no data at all. Using bad data to make decisions can lead to negative consequences, ranging from minor mistakes to business closure.
* Success relies on good data: For data-driven decision-making to be successful, decision-makers need access to high-quality data at the right time.

# MEASURING
* Businesses constantly measure: Organizations, intentionally or unintentionally, are always gathering data through various measurements.
* Measurement leads to better management: The saying "what gets measured gets managed" holds true. By measuring aspects of the business, leaders gain insights to improve management.
* Not everything is measurable: While measurement is important, some things are inherently difficult to quantify.
* Data drives informed decisions: Ultimately, leaders rely on information derived from this measurement data to make informed choices.

  
In essence, measurement is a crucial tool for businesses to track performance, gain insights, and make better decisions.
Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is most often described in numerical terms, whereas qualitative data is descriptive and expressed in terms of language

* Data (Quantitative): Focuses on measurable aspects. Here, data describes the flight's altitude (50,000 meters) and speed (750 km/h).
* Information (Qualitative): Provides descriptive details. In this case, information describes a smooth flight and good meals.
  
Both data and information contribute to understanding the journey, although the value might depend on the audience.

In short, data is the raw numbers, while information adds context and meaning to that data.


* Measurement drives information: The kind of information needed determines how you measure data. This includes what data is captured, when, where, and how.
  
* Focus on what matters: Only collect and measure data that has a clear purpose. While some argue for collecting data "just in case" of future needs, it's crucial to be mindful of resource limitations and potential costs associated with storing unused data.

In essence, target your data collection on what's essential to get the information you need, avoiding unnecessary data gathering


The quote's message: Not everything measurable is truly important, and some crucial things might not be easily quantifiable.
Data enthusiasm vs. relevance: Just because you can collect data doesn't mean it's always valuable. Focus on gathering data that has a clear purpose and provides meaningful insights.
In other words, don't get carried away by the possibility of collecting data. Prioritize collecting data that truly matters and contributes valuable information.

MONITORING 

* Definition: Monitoring is the continuous process of collecting and assessing the performance of something, like a project, system, or process.
* Comparison and Targets: The collected data is often compared to existing standards or desired goals. For instance, a factory machine might be expected to produce a certain number of units per hour (e.g., 100 widgets). Monitoring helps track if this expectation is being met.
* Benefits: Monitoring serves various purposes across different activities:
  * Identifying performance issues (meeting expectations)
  * Ensuring continuity (things keep functioning as intended)
  * Maintaining stability (avoiding unexpected changes)
  * Guaranteeing reliability (performing consistently as expected)
In short, monitoring is a continuous evaluation process that helps ensure things are functioning as planned and meeting established goals.

Involved in monitoring is the data produced by the thing being evaluated. Itâ€™s also the data that is produced as a product of monitoring. For example, the deviation from the expected result.

# Data from Monitoring Drives Insights and Actions

* Monitoring collects data on various aspects (e.g., smartphone battery life, employee activity, production line health).
* This data is used for:
  * Reports (providing summaries)
  * Real-time systems (offering up-to-date information)
  * Dashboards (visualizing key metrics)
* Monitoring helps convert data into actionable insights to guide decision-making.
  
# Data: The Binding Tissue of Measurement and Monitoring

* Measurement and monitoring are closely linked. You can only monitor what you measure.
* Data acts as a connective tissue, tying different business functions together.
* This interdependence requires careful oversight and controls due to:
  * Different teams responsible for measurement, monitoring, reporting, and taking action.
  * Stakeholders with varying permissions.
    
# Monitoring Data Quality

* Data monitoring goes beyond just tracking performance. It also ensures data quality for its intended purpose.
* This requires:
  * Processes to manage data quality
  * Technologies to support data monitoring
  * Benchmarks to define quality expectations
* Data quality monitoring involves setting metrics (e.g., completeness, accuracy) and continuously measuring results.
  
Overall, data monitoring plays a crucial role in collecting valuable data, transforming it into insights, and ensuring data quality for informed decision-making. It highlights the interconnectedness of various business functions through data.


By continuously monitoring the quality of the data in your organization, opportunities and issues may be revealed in a timely manner. Then, if deemed appropriate, actions can be prioritized.

# INSIGHT MANAGEMENT 

# Data: The Fuel for Business Insights

* Data is the foundation for many business functions, especially decision-making.
* Business insights are essentially valuable information derived from data analysis.
  
# Beyond Data Collection: The Need for Insight Management

* Simply gathering data isn't enough. It needs proper management to generate insights.
* Insight management ensures data is utilized effectively to produce valuable insights.
  
# The Insight Management Process

# Data Gathering and Analysis:

* Data is collected from various sources based on a deep understanding of the organization's information needs and data value.
* Analysts must also be aware of information flow within the organization and who needs access to it.
  
# Data Analytics:

  * The collected data is interpreted to uncover its meaning and implications.
    
# Communication of Findings:

  * Insights are communicated effectively, considering different audiences and their needs.
  * Communication methods can vary (e.g., executive summaries for some, detailed reports for others).
    
# Measuring Success: Actionable Insights

* Effective insight communication empowers recipients to make decisions aligned with organizational goals.
  
In essence, insight management is a process that transforms raw data into actionable insights through careful data gathering, analysis, and communication, ultimately driving better decision-making within an organization.

# REPORTING

* Reports: A Core Business Function: Creating, using, and acting on reports are fundamental activities in any organization. Some consider them the backbone of every business, emphasizing their significance.
  
* Structured Communication: Reports present data and information in a structured format, ranging from summaries to detailed breakdowns. The content depends on the audience and purpose (e.g., expenditure report listing departmental costs).
  
* Visuals for Clarity: Including visuals like charts is common. Charts act as a form of data storytelling, making information easier to understand, especially in today's complex business environment. Data storytelling is becoming a crucial business skill.
  
*Report Structure: Reports often include findings, a summary, and sometimes recommendations.

In essence, reports are a structured way to communicate data and information, aiding comprehension and driving action based on the insights they provide.


# Reports: Communicating Data and Information for Action

* Reports are presentations of data and information about various aspects of an organization, either online or physical (written documents).
* Examples include sales reports or presentations on company plans.
* Reports can be delivered in various formats (written, verbal, video), with the focus being on achieving their objective.
* The target audience and purpose of the report determine its content and format.
  
# The Power of Reports: Enabling Informed Decisions

* A major purpose of reporting is to improve decision-making.
* By providing the right information, in the right format, and at the right time, reports empower leaders to:
  * Make better decisions
  * Solve problems more effectively
  * Communicate plans and policies clearly
    
# Beyond Information: The Importance of Action

* While reports offer valuable information, they don't guarantee good decision-making.
  
* Having knowledge is not the same as making the right choices at the right time.
  
In short, reports are a crucial communication tool in organizations. They present data and information in a way that is tailored to a specific audience and purpose, ultimately aiming to empower leaders with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions and take action.

# OTHER ROLES FOR DATA

* Artificial intelligence (AI): AI relies on a lot of good data to function well. This data helps AI find patterns, connections, and probabilities. Interestingly, AI is also being used to improve the quality and usefulness of data itself.
  
* Problem-solving: Data is crucial throughout the problem-solving process. It helps define the problem itself, identify potential solutions, pick the best option, and assess the outcome.

* Data reuse: Data can be a goldmine beyond its initial use. Once collected, data can be reused for different purposes by authorized teams within an organization. This avoids redundant data collection and maximizes its value. However, data governance is crucial to ensure such reuse complies with regulations and privacy.

# IMPROVING OUTCOMES WITH DATA
treating data as a valuable asset is key to maximizing its worth. Many overlook this, but viewing data as an asset can lead to better data management practices.

# IMPORTANT

Data exploration, also known as data analytics, is a core function in organizations that requires skilled professionals and specific tools. The rise of big data has made this process more intricate and demanding of expertise, but it has also heightened the value and significance of data for businesses.


# APROACHING DATA AS AN ASSET
# WHAT IS AN ASSET?
* An asset is something that is owned by a person, an organization, or a government with the expectation that it can bring some economic benefit. This includes the generation of income, the reduction of expenses, or an increase in net worth.
  
* Assets can be either tangible (physical objects you can touch) or intangible (ideas or rights with economic value). Data, like software and brands, is an intangible asset.
  
* Both tangible and intangible assets are important to organizations because they are recorded financially. This financial picture reflects the organization's health, and is crucial for tasks like determining taxes and securing loans.


# EXAMPLES OF ECONOMIC VALUE OF DATA:

* Improves operations.
* Increases existing revenue.
* Produces new forms of revenue.
* Builds relationships with customers and other stakeholders.
* Improves the quality of products and services.
* Contributes to competitive advantage.
* Enables innovation.
* Reduces risk.

Data, though an intangible asset valuable to organizations, isn't always reflected on their financial statements. Accounting standards vary by country, making it a complex issue for another discussion. However, this lack of formal recognition often leads to data being undervalued, underutilized, and inadequately protected.

#  Recognizing that data is an asset is the first step to good data governance.

Recognizing data as an asset brings a new perspective to data management. It emphasizes the importance of understanding what data you have, its quality, and its role in the organization's success. Just like financial assets, good data management requires clear ownership, accountability, and avoiding data silos. If data seems valueless, re-evaluate the need to manage it at all.

# IMPORTANT
Bottom line: Data is an asset and for its value to be leveraged, it must be governed. This may be one of the most important motivations for good data governance.


# DATA ANALYTICS 
Raw data is cryptic and requires analysis to be useful. This process, called data analytics, involves specific tools and techniques to extract meaning and inform sound decision-making. Data analysts play a crucial role in transforming raw data into valuable insights

# FOUR PRIMARY TYPES OF DATA ANALYTICS

* NDescriptive: This type analyzes past data to understand what happened, often focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and business objectives.
  
* Diagnostic: Here, the analysis digs deeper into the "why" behind past events, using descriptive analysis as a foundation.
  
* Predictive: This analysis leverages historical data and trends to forecast future possibilities.
  
* Prescriptive: This analysis builds on predictive techniques, but goes a step further by recommending specific actions based on predicted outcomes.

# THE RELATIVE COMPLEXITY AND BUSINESS VALUE OF FOUR TYPES OF ANALYTICS
