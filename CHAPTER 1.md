# CHAPTER 1: DEFINING DATA GOVERNANCE

Chapter focuses on:

* Unpacking the definition of data governance
* Discovering the elements of a data governance program
* Understanding the role of data culture
* Determining data governance readiness.

# UNDERSTANDING DATA GOVERNANCE
What is data governance: proactively managing your data inorder to support your organization to achieve its strategy and objectives. This is done by improving the quality of your data(Data governance: is simply a framework that you can use to proactively manage your data.

Inorder to be sucessful your framework needs the following 3 things:
* Policy: to mandate how your organization is going to manage data
* roles and responsibility :concernig data
* processes: detailing what needs to be done to manage data.

# WHAT IS MENT BY DATA GOVERNANCE?

Governance is a manner in which entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest. it typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced. when entitiesgrow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. Left ungoverned, the possibility of developing into chaos is very probable

Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results such as meeting goals or sustaining standards can be attained.

# laws

The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent. For example, given their goals as organizations, governance in a public agency such as a city will differ greatly from that of a private enterprise. Each of these entities has different purposes and responsibilities.

# Importance

* Well-managed data can be transformational, and it can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture. This is when decisions at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner such that they deliver better outcomes internally and to customers
  
*Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease. This can bring important comfort to business leaders who, in some jurisdictions, can now be personally liable for issues arising from poor data management.


# Data Governance Versus Data Management

* Data governance: sets the rules for how data is handled within an organization. This includes things like who is responsible for different data sets, what policies are in place to ensure data quality, and how data is measured and tracked throughout its lifecycle.
  
# Data management: is the practical side of things. It's about using technology and tools to implement the data governance rules. This includes things like building databases and data warehouses, securing data with encryption, and analyzing data to make informed decisions.

# Data Governance versus Information Governance

* Data governance: deals with the data itself, regardless of its specific meaning. It focuses on policies and procedures to ensure things like data security, for instance, for patient or staff data. Here, the emphasis is on protecting the data, not its specific use in the business.
  
* Information governance: on the other hand, is all about the meaning and context of data. It looks at how data relates to each other and how it can be used to generate value for the organization, customers, and stakeholders.


# The Value of Data Governance

* Data is seen as critical for success by many businesses. (statistic cited)
  
* Organizations that implement processes to manage data effectively show a commitment to data governance. This involves controlling and being accountable for how data is used.

# SOME OF THE MAIN ADVANTAGES ACHIEVED BY GOOD DATA GOVERNANCE:
* Improved data quality
* Expanded data value
* Increased data compliance
* Improved data-driven decision-making
* Enhanced business performance
* Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
* Increased data availability and accessibility
* Improved data search
* Reduced risks from data-related issues
* Reduced data management costs
* Established rules for handling data

# CREATING A DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM
# The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following:

*Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
* Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
* Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
* Achieving leadership approval.
* Designing and developing the program.
* Implementing the program.
* Monitoring and measuring performance.
* Maintaining the program.

Data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization. It includes ensuring your data is available, usable, and secure. It’s the actions that team members take, the policies and processes they must follow, and the use of technologies that support them throughout the data lifecycle in their organization. It’s safe to say that for a growing number of organizations, data governance is becoming a very big deal.

# THE MOST COMMON ELEMENTS OF DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM:

# Developing a Data Governance Framework

A data governance framework is essentially a blueprint for how an organization manages its data. It's a set of rules, processes, and responsibilities that dictate how data is collected, stored, used, and protected. The goal is :

* High quality: Accurate, consistent, and reliable.
* Secure: Protected from unauthorized access or breaches.
* Compliant: Follows all relevant laws and regulations.
* Accessible: Available to those who need it for legitimate purposes.

# COMMON COMPONENTS OF A DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

* Roles and responsibilities: Who is accountable for different aspects of data governance? (e.g., data stewards, data quality specialists)
  
* Policies: Guidelines for how data should be handled (e.g., data security policies, data retention policies)
  
* Standards: Definitions and formats for data to ensure consistency (e.g., data dictionaries)
  
* Metrics: How will you measure the success of your data governance program? (e.g., data quality metrics)
  
* Processes: Specific procedures for handling data throughout its lifecycle (e.g., data cleansing procedures)

* Tools: There's a wide range of software to support data governance and management tasks.
These tools address various needs such as managing master data, creating data catalogs, data searching, data security, data integration, data analysis, and ensuring compliance with regulations.
Recently, data science tools have become easier to use and more automated, making data management less complex.
This improvement allows more people to participate in effectively managing data and extracting value from it.

* Communications and Collaboration; Data governance involves ongoing changes, so keeping everyone informed is crucial.
This communication can happen through various channels like meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
Special attention needs to be paid to explaining how these changes impact different teams and their responsibilities within the data governance program.

# PREPARING FOR DATA GOVERNANCE

* Just setting up a team, plan, and buying tools isn't enough for successful data governance.
  
* Organizations need to assess if they're prepared for the cultural shift it entails.
  
* A key factor is having a data culture - how data is viewed and handled within the organization.
  
* A mature, data-driven culture is much more receptive to data governance than a reactive one where data handling is haphazard.
  
* Another crucial element for success is ensuring the organization's overall strategy aligns with the data governance program. Misalignment is a major reason for program failures.

WHAT IS DATA CULTURE?

* Impact on Success: A strong data culture is a critical factor for successful data governance implementation.  If employees don't understand the importance of data quality, security, and responsible use, data governance initiatives will likely face resistance and struggle to achieve their goals.

# Characteristics of a Good Data Culture:
A data-driven culture is characterized by:

* Data awareness: People recognize the value of data and its potential to improve decision-making.
  
* Data literacy: Employees have the skills and knowledge to understand, work with, and analyze data effectively.
  
* Data sharing: There's an openness to sharing data across departments to achieve organizational goals.
  
* Data accountability: People are held responsible for the quality and responsible use of data they handle.
  
* Data Governance Fosters a Data Culture:  While a strong data culture is essential for successful data governance, the process itself can also help cultivate those positive attitudes and behaviors. By setting clear policies, promoting data literacy programs, and demonstrating the value of data-driven decision making, data governance initiatives can influence how people view and interact with data throughout the organization.


# Assessing the Data Culture





# Maturing the Data Culture:

* Leadership champions data: Leaders need to actively communicate the importance of data and demonstrate its value through real-world examples of successful data-driven decisions.

* Empowering employees: Provide basic data skills training covering data manipulation, analysis, cleansing, querying, and visualization. Don't underestimate the power of common tools like spreadsheets for data management.

* Start small, celebrate progress: Focus on achievable steps to initiate the data culture journey.  Basic data management skills training can be a good starting point. Celebrate even small wins to keep momentum going.

* Embrace challenges:  Acknowledge that there will be resistance and frustration during this culture shift.  Focus on providing support mechanisms like open communication channels and positive discussions to address concerns and celebrate successes.

# Assessing Data Governance Readiness

Unfortunately, the success rate of data governance programs on the first try remains low. It’s important to maximize the conditions for success. You may not get a second chance.
