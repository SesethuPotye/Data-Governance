# EXAMINING THE BOARDER VALUE OF DATA

In small businesses, data is often manageable. There are few data systems, and team members know where most data resides, like customer information or invoices. This allows for easy data access by team members without needing specialists, which is called data democratization.

# IMPORTANT 

As organizations grow and more systems are employed, eventually no single person knows what data is available and where it is in the enterprise. Without this knowledge, the ability to properly govern your data and leverage its value is greatly hampered. Without deliberate actions, data democratization becomes elusive.

# THE CHALLENGES OF DATA SILOS AND THE IMPORTANACE OF DATA DISCOVERABILITY

* Data Silos: Over time, data gets compartmentalized into isolated repositories called data silos. This happens due to various factors like culture, strategy, or mergers.
* Impact of Silos: Data silos cause problems:
  * Reduced efficiency: Collaboration is hindered as different teams don't have 
    access to each other's data.
  * Increased inconsistencies: Data inconsistencies arise when the same information 
    is stored differently in silos.
  * Security and regulatory risks: Siloed data management makes it harder to secure 
    data and comply with regulations.
    
* Data Governance and Discovery: Data governance helps break down silos by making data discoverable and accessible throughout the organization. Data catalogs are a key tool for data governance in achieving this.
* The Data Search Struggle: Unlike a web search engine, finding data within an 
  organization is often difficult.
  * Finding relevant data can take up 70% of an analyst's time, leaving only 30% for 
   actual analysis (according to an IBM survey).
  * Ironically, it can be easier to find information about your own company through 
  a public search engine than through internal systems.

The passage highlights the importance of overcoming data silos and making data discoverable to improve data utilization and efficiency.



# Knowing what data is available is essential for the following reasons:

* Better informed decision-making.
* Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements.
* Lower costs by avoiding duplicate system and data efforts.
* Improved data analytics and reporting.
* Higher performing systems.
* More efficient operations.
* Reducing data inconsistencies across the enterprise.

# Data Catalogs
* Enterprise Search Engine: This is a challenging option with limitations. While it can find data locations, it might not uncover hidden confidential data or assess data quality (accuracy, completeness, etc.).
  
* Enterprise Data Catalog: This is a more popular approach, like a product catalog in a store. It lists available data sets and provides valuable details about them, making it easier to locate and understand the data you need


# 3 ESSENTAIL BENEFITS OF DATA CATALOGS

* Finding data: Helps users identify and locate data that may be useful.
  
* Understanding data:  Answers a wide variety of data questions such as its purpose and who uses it.
  
* Making data more useful:  Creates visibility, describes value, and provides access to information.

# IMPORTANT 

Done right, a data catalog delivers a comprehensive inventory that provides an enterprise view of all data. This view provides essential insight that helps with leveraging data value and provides a robust tool to assist with data governance. 

# BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OD A DATA CATALOG

* A data catalog is essentially a directory of an organization's data holdings. It goes beyond just listing datasets; it also includes valuable details about the data itself, which is called metadata.
* Metadata can be entered manually or automatically retrieved from other sources. Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in automating metadata collection.
* The presence of metadata makes a data catalog even more valuable because it allows users to understand the data better. This includes aspects like what the data represents, its format, quality, and how current it is.

# 3 TYPES OF METADATA IN DATA CATALOG

* Technical metadata:  Data about the design of a data set such as its tables, columns, file names, and other documentation related to the source system.
* Business metadata:  Organizational data such as a business description, how it is used, its relevancy, an assessment of data quality, and users and their interactions.
* Operational metadata:  Data such as when the data was last accessed, who accessed it, and when was it last backed up.

EXAMPLES OF METADATA

* Associated systems.
* File names.
* File locations.
* Data owners.
* Data descriptions.
* Dates created.
* Dates last modified.
* List of database tables and views.
* Data stewards.
* Size of data sets.
* Quality score.
* Comments.

For a large number of stakeholders ranging from data analysts to data stewards, a data catalog presents many advantages. Primarily, the ability to find data tops the list. But it provides much more than that.

# With a data catalog, an organization can:

* Know what data it has (and by extension, know what data is missing).
* Reduce data duplication.
* Increase operational efficiencies and innovation.
* Understand data quality.
* Manage compliance.
* Enjoy cost savings from improved operations.

A well-managed data catalog can be transformational for an organization. The effort to create and maintain one should not be understated. But, without a doubt, a data catalog is often the basis for delivering successful data governance and data management.
