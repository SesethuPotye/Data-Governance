# Data-Governance

Data is one of the most importanat resources an organization possesses in todays economy.

# WHAT IS DATA GOVERNANCE

* Data governance is a set of rules and procedures to manage an organization's data. It ensures data is accurate, secure, and usable for various purposes.
* Similar to how governments create laws, organizations set data policies to define how data is used, accessed, and protected.
* These policies cover data quality, data attributes, data access permissions, data security, regulations compliance, and data privacy.
* Organizations also implement controls (procedures and technology) to enforce these data governance standards.
* Successful data governance requires strong support from executives across the organization, not just the IT department.

# Data Governance Roles

* Data Stewardship: Overseeing data quality, security, privacy, and regulation compliance.
Organizational Data Steward: Leads data governance activities and connects technical and non-technical teams.
Works with Data Owners (senior leaders responsible for specific data areas) to define policies.
May delegate tasks to Subject Area Data Stewards (understand nuances of their specific data domain)

* Data Owners: Senior leaders responsible for a specific data domain (e.g., finance, HR).

* Data Custodians: (Often IT staff) implement technical controls to enforce data governance policies (e.g., configuring access controls).

# Collaboration is Key

The organizational data steward works with all these roles to ensure proper data governance:

* Vertically (across different levels) with data owners and subject area data stewards.
* Horizontally with data custodians responsible for implementing technical controls.
  
# Data Access Requirements

* Access to data is granted based on specific needs.
* Access level varies by data domain and can be limited to specific data fields.
* Example: Managers need access to employee names, contact info, and performance data, but not Social Security numbers.

# Determining access requirements
it is essential to develop a data classification matrix. A data classification matrix defines categories, and disclosure implications for data.

# Access Permissions

It is granting access based on roles simplifies permission management, especially with employee job changes.


Example: Ralph changes roles from Finance to Facilities to HR (Figure 2).
His access is adjusted based on his new role (Finance -> Facilities -> HR).

# BENEFITS OF ROLE-BASED ACCESS

* Easier to maintain permissions and ensure consistency.
* Users only have access to data required for their current role (data security).
* Simplifies permission audits for compliance.

# RISKS OF USER-BASED ACCESS

* Assigning permissions directly to users is risky and complex.
* Increases chance of errors, like forgetting to remove old permissions (Figure 3).
* Can lead to users having too much access (security risk).

# Group Permissions

When developing a role-based access strategy, it is common to implement user group-based permissions.
